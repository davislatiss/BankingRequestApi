# BankingRequestApi

Completed requests from the Seb Accounts Information Api.
Postman collection of requests exported as json file and added to the project. I made a seperate .py file for each request. Imported requests and json libraries.
Hardest part of the project for me was making the Oauth2.0 work but after managing it the work was straightforward just looking at the documentation, which
was very well made by Seb bank. Overall not a very difficult task just a lot of reading through the documentation.
